## Connect-Four Typescript Coding Challenge

This is my submission for a coding challenge to create a connect four game with React/Typescript. Commit history has been erased along with references to the company this was for. See the original criteria below:

## Objective

Create a 2-player game of Connect Four with TypeScript and React.

## Prompt

Create a two-player game of [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)

### Requirements

- The board should be 7 wide by 6 high
- It should alternate between the 'red' and 'yellow' players turn
- Clicking the "Drop" button should drop a token of the current player's to the bottom-most free position
- Clicking the "Drop" button on a full column should have no effect
- If either player gets four in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally):
  - The "COLOR's turn" heading should be replaced by "COLOR won!"
  - The "Drop" buttons should be replaced by a "Play again" button
- If the board is full and there is no winner:
  - The "COLOR's turn" heading should be replaced by "Draw!"
  - The "Drop" buttons should be replaced by a "Play again" button

### Evaluation Criteria

- **TypeScript** best practices
- Show us your work through your commit history
- We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program
- Completeness: Did you complete the features?
- Correctness: Does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: Is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
